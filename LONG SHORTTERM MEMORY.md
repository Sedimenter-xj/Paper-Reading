# LONG SHORTTERM MEMORY

 Learning to store information over extended time intervals via recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time mostly due to insufficient decaying error back flow.We briefly review Hochreiter's 1991 analysis of this problem. then address it by introducing a novel. efficient. gradient-based method called Long ShortTerm Memory LSTM. Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of  discrete time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carrousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow .LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local distributed realvalued and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL,BPTT.Recurrent Cascade-Correlation. Elman nets and Neural Sequence Chunking. LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex artificial long time lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.
